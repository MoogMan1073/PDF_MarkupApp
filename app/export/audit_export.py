"""Exporting an audit report.

Three formats for three audiences: HTML to file with a project record, Markdown
to paste into a review, CSV to sort in a spreadsheet.  All three carry the same
two things that make a finding checkable — the clause it rests on and the
arithmetic or facts behind it — plus the coverage statement, which is not
optional in any of them.

GUI-free, like its siblings in this package.
