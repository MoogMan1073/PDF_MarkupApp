"""Resolving each page's sheet number.

Every location-based design rule compares a tag's *declared* sheet against the
sheet it was actually found on, so this value is the input the whole audit rests
on.  Getting it wrong does not produce no findings; it produces confident wrong
ones.

Measured on a real AutoCAD Electrical plot, the original title-block heuristics
resolved **0 of 14** pages: the keyword pattern matched an explanatory note
("A WIRE ON SHEET 26 LINE 12...") rather than a title block, and the corner
fallback found no text at all because ACADE plots the title block in SHX shape
fonts, which arrive as vector geometry rather than words.

What does work on those plots is the drawing number, which carries the sheet as
a suffix (``EL2507777-300``) and resolved **14 of 14**.  So that strategy leads,
the older heuristics stay as fallbacks with the region guard they were missing,
and every answer records which strategy produced it — because a rule that cannot
tell a certain sheet number from a guessed one cannot report coverage honestly.

GUI-free, like its siblings.
